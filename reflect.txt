/*
   I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and  assignments.
*/


- This assignment wrapped OOP345 course in one folder. It covered almost every topic including algorithms, files and modular programming. Workshops were quite easy 
  as compared to milestones. The reason was that the instructions in workshop were easy to understand and implement whereas in third milestone, the instructions were
  too hard to interpret. I got stuck many times while completing this milestone. One of the situations were that when I was implementing "run" function in LineManager 
  module, for some reason "incomplete" queue was not accepting push_back elements. I tried to debug it and also went through the notes to identify where I was wrong. 
  Later, after searching through whole code for twice, I realised that I was not returing correct boolean variable and that was why my queue was empty. Because the guidelines
  hard to follow, it was difficult to debug the code. If this milestone mentioned somewhere of what was expected from students, it would have been easy to code. 
  Nevertheless, I felt very proud and satisfied of having completed this project before due date.
